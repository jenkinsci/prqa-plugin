    The QA&middot;Framework package comes with a number of configuration files to support a wide range of Version Control Systems. These can be found in the VCF sub directory of the user's local app area e.g. on windows "%localappdata%/Perforce/Helix-QAC-<version>/config" and on Unix machine "~/.config/Perforce/Helix-QAC-<version>/config/". Note that the configuration file may need to be customised to work with particular deployments of the Version Control System.

    If you dont wish to use VCS and want All code uploaded to Dashboard Server then you still need to select a configuration file (single-comb.xml) to include the file versions and authors in the snapshot. If you do not want the file information you should choose single-sop.xml.
