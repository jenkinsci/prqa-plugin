    Project Based CMA Analysis is link time checking and is performed once all of the source files have been analyzed.
    Project Based CMA Analysis must be enabled to fully enforce a coding standard.

    Note that Project Based CMA Analysis may take a long time to complete.
    If enabled, it will always be run regardless of the dependency based analysis setting.

    Note also that this option applies to PRQA Framework versions prior to 2.1.0. From version 2.1.0 onwards, CMA analysis is configured through the project toolchain.
